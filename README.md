# 3-Body Problem Simulator

An interactive, browser-based simulation of the **three-body problem** with realistic astrophysical units and dynamic visualisation. WORKS BEST ON PC

**Live demo:** https://adilneaz.github.io/3-Body-simulator-/

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Real physics** using astronomical units (AU), solar masses (Mâ˜‰), and km/s.
- **Interactive controls**: set initial positions, velocities, and masses for each body.
- **Time control**: adjustable simulation speed with pause/start buttons.
- **Smooth zoom and pan**: mouse-wheel zoom (centred on cursor), right-click drag to pan.
- **Velocity-based trails**: dynamic colour gradient (blue â†’ red) based on each body's speed.
- **Dynamic speed legend**: log-scaled, draggable, with real-time min/max speed in m/s.
- **Info panel**: explains all units and controls; pauses simulation when open.
- **Presets**: Sunâ€“Earthâ€“Jupiter, binary + probe, and a figure-8 approximation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Educational Purpose
This simulator visualises **chaos in orbital mechanics** â€” small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes, a hallmark of chaotic systems in astrophysics.

Use it to explore:
- Orbital stability and resonance
- Gravitational scattering and capture/ejection
- Sensitivity to initial conditions

## ðŸ›  How to Use
1. Open the **Live demo** link above.
2. Click in the canvas to place/select a body; **drag** to set its initial velocity vector.
3. Adjust mass (Mâ˜‰), position (AU), and velocity (km/s) from the control panel.
4. Scroll to **zoom**, right-click and drag to **pan**.
5. Open the **Help** tab for unit explanations and controls.
